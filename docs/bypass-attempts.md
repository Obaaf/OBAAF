# Bypass attempts, rule by rule

This page records every attempt to get past OBAAF's security rules: who tried, what they tried, what got through, and what changed. It is the record plan slice 2d.2 asks for ("every rule has a recorded attempt"). A rule's description in the [rule catalogue](../spec/checker-rules.md) says what the rule does not follow; this page says how that was found.

How an attempt is made. A reviewer that did not write the rule (an Opus 5.5 sub-agent, given the code and the rule's definition, not the author's opinion of it) writes small workflows meant to get a secret, a permission or a signing key past the rule, and runs the checker on each. A way past counts only if GitHub would run the workflow and the job would really get what the rule is about, while OBAAF reports nothing, a weaker case or severity than the plain spelling gets, or facts such that an acceptance of a harmless case also covers the risky one. Each way past becomes a test, and the fix is to the class (read it properly, read it the widest way, or fail the check), not to the one spelling.

Where a way past depends on what GitHub does and the documentation does not say, the record says "not verified". The fix is chosen so that it is right either way.

## 2d.2b: what a job can reach

Run `knot`, 2026-11-14. Two reviewers worked in parallel on a copy of `flagship` at `0bd97f4`: one on OBAAF-GHA-005, 018 and 024 (44 test workflows), one on OBAAF-GHA-001, 003 and 004 (about 70). A third reviewer then attacked the fixes. Expectrail at `5433b5e` (read-only copy) and this repository were checked with the old and new code: the only differences are the intended ones.

GitHub's documentation was read for: reusable workflows and the token a called workflow gets ("The `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions passed from the caller workflow can be only downgraded", [Reusing workflow configurations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/reusing-workflow-configurations)); environments created on first use ("will create an environment with the referenced name ... will not have any protection rules or secrets configured", [Managing environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/manage-environments)); `deployment: false` ("The job has full access to environment secrets and variables"; required reviewers and wait timers still apply; branch policies are not mentioned, [Control deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/control-deployments)). Not verified: whether GitHub accepts permission scopes, levels and event names in another case, and what it does with an empty or numeric environment name.

### Shared by all six: how secrets and permissions are read

**Held.** The secret reader (`secret_names`, from 2d.1) found every spelling tried: workflow-level `env` read later as `$X`; YAML anchors within and across jobs; a workflow written entirely in flow mappings; `services.*.env` and `container.credentials`; `SECRETS.x`, `secrets [ 'X' ]`, `(secrets).X`, `(a || secrets).X`, `fromJSON(toJSON(secrets)).X`, `secrets[join(...)]`, `secrets.*`, a double-quoted index; `}}` and `${{` inside strings; `\x24{{` and `${{` YAML escapes; an expression used as an `env` key. YAML the reader refuses (a tab before `#`, two documents, duplicate keys) fails the check.

**Got through, fixed.**

- *Permissions spellings.* `permissions: Write-All`, `permissions: write`, an expression, `contents: WRITE`, `contents: " write"`, `Contents: write`, `ID-TOKEN: write`, `permissions: " read-all"`: each was read as no permissions (or as read-all), with no word. GitHub probably rejects most of them (not verified). Now each is an error for the file and is read as the widest grant.
- *`permissions:` with no value* at job level was read as `{}` and hid a workflow-level `write-all`. Now it is taken as not written.
- *Event names.* `on: Pull_Request_Target` and `on: [{pull_request_target: {}}]` were dropped without a word. Now an event not written in lower-case letters and underscores is an error for the file.
- *Numbers of thousands of digits* in `on:`, `permissions:` or `environment:` ended the check in a traceback (status 1, no report). Now they are read as text or are an error for the file.

### OBAAF-GHA-001 Secret available to a workflow started by untrusted input

**Held.** `on:` as a string, list, flow mapping, quoted key, anchor or alias; narrowing by `if:` only for plain comparisons of `github.event_name` (`contains`, `startsWith`, `format`, `fromJSON` and negations narrow nothing); `needs` chains, cycles and missing jobs; `workflow_run` after a push versus after a pull request; secrets through `env`, a reusable call's `secrets:`, `with:`, `secrets: inherit`, `toJSON(secrets)`.

**Got through, fixed.**

- *Any `environment:` lowered the finding from high to medium*, including `tmp-${{ github.run_id }}` (created on first use with no reviewers) and `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}` (the pull request's author picks it). Now only a name written in plain text lowers it.
- *The environment was not part of the finding*: an acceptance for the job in `sandbox` covered it in `production`. Now it is a fact.

**Not fixed, stated as limits.** Events an app can raise for an outsider's change (`check_run`, `check_suite`, `status`, `deployment`, `deployment_status`) and `merge_group` are not treated as untrusted; whether an outsider can raise them depends on the apps installed, which OBAAF does not read. A workflow with only `workflow_call` is never reported; its caller is, when checked in the same run.

### OBAAF-GHA-003 Agent job can write

**Held.** `write-all` quoted and unquoted; quoted keys and values; anchors, aliases, flow mappings; job-level `read-all` or `{}` over workflow-level `write-all`; no permissions anywhere (reported as undeclared).

**Got through, fixed.**

- *A called workflow that declares nothing* holds its caller's token, but was reported as "undeclared", the same facts as a job whose repository default is read-only. Now it is the case `inherited`.
- The permissions spellings above.

**Not fixed, stated as limits.** The repository's default token permissions are not read. An agent wrapped in a local composite action (`uses: ./.github/actions/x`) does not make the job an agent job: slice 2d.4.

### OBAAF-GHA-004 Agent job can request cloud credentials

**Got through, fixed.**

- *A called workflow that declares nothing* got no finding, though its caller can grant `id-token: write`. Now it is reported, case `inherited`.
- *`ID-TOKEN: write`* was a write scope to OBAAF-GHA-003 and nothing to OBAAF-GHA-004. Now a scope in another case counts as that scope (and the file fails the check).

**Not fixed, stated as a limit.** The checker takes the repository default never to include `id-token: write`.

### OBAAF-GHA-005 Secret available to an agent job

**Got through, fixed.**

- *The environment was not part of the finding.* An acceptance written for the agent job in `sandbox` covered it in `production`, where the same reference reads production's secret (an environment's secret takes precedence over a repository secret of the same name). Now the environment is a fact.

**Not fixed, stated as limits.** In a local reusable agent workflow, the finding names the secret parameter (`MODEL_KEY`), not the secret the caller maps onto it (`PROD_DEPLOY_KEY`), and the calling job is not an agent job, so changing the mapping raises nothing: slice 2d.4. Secrets that reach the agent through artifacts, caches, files or another job's outputs are not followed. `Secrets: inherit` with a capital S is not read (GitHub very probably rejects the key; not verified).

### OBAAF-GHA-018 Signing key available to build steps

**Held.** `cosign_private_key`, `SECRETS['Gpg_Private_Key']`, `${{secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE}}`, `\x24{{ }}`, `format('}}{0}', secrets.DEVELOPER_ID_CERT)`; a signing secret in workflow `env` or `container.credentials`; a caller passing `SIGNING_KEY` under another name; one-line `cosign sign --key`, `gpg --import`, `signtool /f`, `jarsigner -keystore`, `apksigner --ks`.

**Got through, fixed.**

- *A job that can read every secret* (`secrets[format('{0}_KEY','SIGNING')]`, `secrets[matrix.key]`, `toJSON(secrets)`, `secrets: inherit`) got no finding: the rule dropped them. Now case `any-secret`.
- *Continued lines*: `cosign sign \` on two lines, and PowerShell's backtick and cmd's caret (found by the third reviewer). Now matched both as written and joined, so joining never hides what one line shows (the second pass found that matching only the joined text hid a file-key `cosign sign` followed on the joined line by a KMS one).
- *Commands, actions and names the data missed*: `/usr/bin/gpg`, `gpg2`, `gpg.exe`, options before `--import` (also a quoted value with spaces, though `--passphrase="a b"` is still missed), `.P12`, `Import-PfxCertificate`, `crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg`, `apple-actions/import-codesign-certs`; `CSC_LINK`, `MACOS_CERTIFICATE`, `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `KEY_STORE`. Added. `gpg --import-ownertrust` and a `gpg --version` line followed by another command's `--import` are no longer taken for a key import.
- *The environment was not part of a secrets finding.* Now it is a fact.

**Not fixed, stated as limits.** Signing material is recognised by name and command patterns, which can always be missed (a key stored as `BLOB`, a signing tool not in the data). A step reported for its command is identified by its name, not its text, so an accepted harmless step (`gpg --import public.asc`) keeps its acceptance if it later imports a private key and signs; putting a step's text in its identity would make every edit a new finding, and is left for a decision on identity.

### OBAAF-GHA-024 Protected secret used outside its environment

**Held.** All 13 expression spellings were reported, with "it can take every secret" where it applies; `RELEASE` and `{name: Release}` match `release`; `" release"` with a space is reported (stricter, not looser); a protected secret passed by name to a reusable workflow is reported. A merge key that supplies `environment:` is read by this YAML reader and, as far as is known, not by GitHub's (not verified).

**Got through, fixed.**

- *`secrets: inherit` was silent* where passing the secret by name was high; both pass the repository or organization copy wherever one exists. Now reported alike.
- *Two entries for one name in different case* (`PYPI_TOKEN: release`, `pypi_token: staging`): the second replaced the first. Now a configuration error.
- *Names equal only under Unicode case folding* (`Kube-prod` with the Kelvin sign, `straße` and `strasse`, `releaſe`) were taken for the protected environment. Now compared by the case of A to Z only; the others are unconfirmed (medium), as the OBAAF-GHA-005 control already did.
- *An environment that is not a name.* `environment: 010` matched a protected `"8"`; a blank name counted as declared. Now a number or true or false is unconfirmed only where it could be the wanted name, a blank or missing name is no environment (high), and a list or mapping is not a name (high). The third reviewer found that the first version of this fix lowered `environment: 1` from high to medium, and its second pass that `environment: 1` was still medium against a protected `"8"`; now the value is unconfirmed only where the wanted name is one of the names it may be (`010` may be `8`, `10` or `010`), read from the text as written. Text this reader keeps as text that a YAML 1.2 reader takes for a number (`0o10`, `1e3`) is treated the same way unless quoted. Where the text as written cannot be found (an environment that comes through a merge key, a job whose id YAML reads as true, false or a number), a number is unconfirmed against any wanted name that looks like a number, and plain `0o10` is read as text: the third pass found both, and GitHub very probably refuses merge keys (not verified).
- *Fact `via`* said only yes or no, so an acceptance of a caller passing `toJSON(secrets)` covered one with `secrets: inherit` (found by the third reviewer). Now it says which.

**Not fixed, stated as limits.** An environment named by an expression is never evaluated, even `${{ 'staging' }}` or a literal matrix, and stays medium. `environment: {name: release, deployment: false}` counts as `release`: GitHub says the job gets the environment's secrets and its reviewers still apply, and does not say whether its branch policy does. The checker never sees where a secret is stored or an environment's branch rule; `obaaf audit` reads those.

## 2d.2c: what a run checks out

Run `skua`, 2026-11-14. One reviewer (an Opus 5.5 sub-agent that did not write the rules) worked on a copy of `flagship` at `01d7005` and wrote 106 workflows against OBAAF-GHA-002, 011, 012 and 019: **57 got through**, in 16 classes; 3 were not counted and 1 was out of the rules' scope. A second reviewer attacked OBAAF-GHA-010, 013 and 015 at the same time; those three rules are a later tranche (see [the plan](flagship.md)), and its results are published with their fixes. The new code was then run on every attempt, on this repository, the templates, the risky fixtures and Expectrail at `9dc79d5` (read-only copy) with its baseline, against the old code: the only differences are the intended ones (below).

The reviewer read actions/checkout's own reading of `persist-credentials` in its v3.5.0 source, `(core.getInput('persist-credentials') || 'false').toUpperCase() === 'TRUE'`, and its `action.yml` ("Otherwise, uses the default branch" for a `repository` with no `ref`), through a mirror; the github.com sources could not be reached from the session, so later versions were not read. actions/checkout v7 (and its backports from July 2026) refuses a fork's head on `pull_request_target` and on `workflow_run` after a pull request, however the ref is spelled ([changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-06-18-safer-pull_request_target-defaults-for-github-actions-checkout)); it does nothing for `issue_comment`, for fetch commands, or for a checkout pinned to a commit from before the change, which OBAAF-GHA-008 asks for. So the rules stay needed. Not verified: that GitHub reads context and property names without regard to case (OBAAF's expression reader has assumed it since 2d.1), how v7 parses `allow-unsafe-pr-checkout`, whether the runner matches input names without regard to case, and that `workflow_run.pull_requests` is empty for a fork's pull request.

### OBAAF-GHA-002 Untrusted code checked out in a privileged workflow

**Held.** The plain head SHA; spaces inside `${{ }}`; `refs/pull/${{ github.event.number }}/head`; `workflow_run.head_sha` and `head_repository.full_name`; `merge_commit_sha`; `Actions/Checkout`; inputs through an anchor, a flow mapping with quoted keys and `Ref:`, a block scalar; `gh pr checkout`; `git fetch refs/pull/...` then `git switch`; `on:` as a flow list with an anchor; `if:` with `contains()`, a negation or `github.event.action` (none narrows the trigger); `pull_request_review`; a `needs` chain with `!cancelled()`.

**Got through, fixed.** `ref` and `repository` were matched as text against a pattern of plain spellings, and scripts against one spelling per command.

- *The ref in another spelling:* `head['sha']`, `GitHub.Event.Pull_Request.Head.SHA`, `format('refs/{0}/{1}/merge', 'pull', github.event.number)`, the same with `issue.number` on `issue_comment`, `join(fromJSON(...))`, `fromJSON(toJSON(github.event.pull_request.head)).sha`, and the SHA given through the job's or the workflow's `env`. Now both inputs are read with the expression reader and `env` is followed to where it is set.
- *The fork's repository with no `ref`* (`repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}`), which checks out the fork's default branch. Now the head repository is the pull request's code.
- *A ref computed while the job runs* (`steps.pr.outputs.sha` after `gh pr view --json headRefOid`, or `needs.resolve.outputs.sha`: the usual `issue_comment` pattern). Now any value the checker cannot read to a value is case `checkout-unresolved`, medium, "cannot tell".
- *Fetch commands:* `git fetch origin <head SHA>` then `git checkout FETCH_HEAD`; `git -c x=y checkout`; `git -C . fetch`; `git pull`; `git clone` of the head's clone URL; a line continuation; `gh pr diff | git apply`; `curl` of the patch; `/usr/bin/gh` or `"gh"`; `gh pr --repo X checkout`; `gh api .../tarball/<sha>`; `git reset --hard <sha>`; `exec.exec('git', ['fetch', ...])` in github-script; `subprocess.run(['git', 'fetch', ...])` with `shell: python`; `git fetch` in a `docker://` step's `args`. Now a script is split as a shell splits it, command by command (continued lines joined; a pipeline is one command; a quoted script given to `sh -c` read again): a command that brings code in, and something in the same command that names the pull request's code, is case `fetch`, high. What names it: an expression or `env` value that does, a field read from the event file (`.pull_request.head.sha`), from `gh pr view` (`headRefOid`) or `gh pr diff`, `GITHUB_HEAD_REF`, `refs/pull/` or `pull/N/head`, the pull request's number, a variable set earlier in the step from any of these, or a file an earlier command wrote from them. Such a command with a step's or job's output is case `fetch-unresolved`, medium.
- *Identity:* a checkout guarded by `if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository` and the same checkout unguarded were one finding, so a baseline entry for the first accepted the second (checked with `--write-baseline` and `--baseline`). Now the job's and step's `if:` and what was read are facts.

**Not counted.** `workflow_run.pull_requests[0].head.sha` (said to be empty for a fork's pull request; it is now reported anyway, as a pull request's code); `with:` written as one expression (GitHub very probably refuses it; it is now "cannot tell"); `gh pr --repo X checkout` before the fix was judged unverified (it is now reported).

**Review of the fixes.** A second reviewer (a fresh Opus 5.5 sub-agent) attacked the first version of the fixes and found nine blocking faults, all fixed and each a test (`FirstReviewTest`):

- *Slowness.* The pattern for git's options backtracked: a run of `=` after `git --a` took 97 s on a 100 KB line. Eight env values that each read all eight took 83 s, because each name was read again on every path. An unclosed `${{` repeated took seconds. Now commands are found by splitting the line into words (Python's `shlex`, with a rough split for a line it refuses), each env name is read once, and expressions are found in one pass: each of these inputs takes under a second.
- *Option values in quotes* (`git -C "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE" fetch`, `git -c 'user.name=x' fetch`, `--git-dir="$D/.git"`, `gh pr -R "o/r" checkout`) were missed. The word split reads them.
- *Fetched, then applied on another line*: `gh pr diff "$N" > pr.diff` then `git apply pr.diff`; `curl` of the patch address to a file then `git am`; `| patch -p1`; a github-script `getContent` or `pulls.get` call written over several lines. Now a file written from the pull request's code is followed, `patch` is a command that brings code in, a download of the patch or diff address counts wherever the address comes from, and a github-script script is read whole.
- *False positives the first version added* on ordinary `pull_request_target` workflows: a branch created with the pull request's number in its name (`git switch -c "pr-$N" main`); an env name read as a word anywhere (`BRANCH` in `--branch`, `PR` in `pr-labels`, `N` in `-n`); a comment or a second command on the same line (`git checkout main # PR $N`, `git fetch origin main && gh pr comment "$N"`); `git merge-base` and `git show-ref` taken for `merge` and `show`. Now a variable counts only where the script reads it (`$NAME`, `${NAME}`, `$env:NAME`, `process.env.NAME` and the like), only the same command counts, a word that begins with `#` ends it, subcommands are whole words, and the name of a branch being created is not read.
- *Identity of "cannot tell".* Two checkouts of `${{ steps.pr.outputs.sha }}`, where the step echoes the base commit in one and the head commit in the other, were one finding, so accepting the harmless one (as the finding invites) covered the other. Now the producing step, or the job for a `needs` output, is part of the finding as a digest of how it is written.
- *A token or SSH key given to checkout* was reported as "the job token", with the same facts as a read-only job. Now the credential is named and is a fact.
- *A traceback* on `allow-unsafe-pr-checkout` set to a number of thousands of digits (older than this slice).
- *Claims the code did not meet*: only one assignment per line was followed (now `read`, `for NAME in`, `typeset`, several on one line); a bash line ending in a backquote was joined to the next as if it were PowerShell (now only for a PowerShell step); a step's `REF: ${{ env.REF }}` was read as itself, not the job's `REF` (now each scope reads the ones outside it); `${{ 0 }}` counted as opting in (now a constant).

Of its non-blocking points, these were fixed too: OBAAF-GHA-012 has the `if:` as a fact; OBAAF-GHA-019 has the triggers; the old message for the merge-commit case is kept only where 0.3.0 reported it (on `pull_request`), so `obaaf baseline migrate` cannot carry a 0.3.0 entry over to a review-event finding 0.3.0 never made; `github.event.after`, a review's and a review comment's `commit_id` and the head's owner are the head; the base repository's owner, clone address and label, and `workflow_run.repository`, are the base; and an agent CLI name after a path is now matched only for the CLIs with a prompt flag or subcommand (`claude -p`, `codex exec` and the like), because `cd packages/cline` and `rm -rf /tmp/aider` made agent jobs. Left as limits: the job's `environment` is not a fact of OBAAF-GHA-002; what a fetch is used for afterwards is not either; a literal matrix value is "cannot tell"; OBAAF-GHA-012 does not see the merge commit fetched by a script (`git fetch origin "$GITHUB_REF"`) or `github.workflow_sha`; `mapfile`, shell functions, arrays, `git` aliases, `hub`, `degit` and `svn` are not followed.

**Not fixed, stated as limits.** A local composite action given the head SHA (`uses: ./.github/actions/checkout-pr`), and a reusable workflow called from a `pull_request_target` workflow that checks out `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` or `inputs.ref`: the called workflow is read with its own trigger, `workflow_call`, and the caller has no steps. Both belong to slice 2d.4 (local reusable workflows and composite actions) and are in its entry. Values passed between steps through `GITHUB_ENV` or files are not followed. A line that names the pull request's code but runs a command the list does not name is not reported: reporting every use of a pull request's number would report every bot that comments.

### OBAAF-GHA-019 Unsafe pull-request checkout explicitly allowed

**Held.** `true`, `True`, `"TRUE"`, `' true '`, `Allow-Unsafe-PR-Checkout:`, a merge-key anchor, a block scalar.

**Got through, fixed.** `${{ true }}`, `${{ 'true' }}`, `${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request_target' }}`, `${{ env.UNSAFE }}`, `${{ format('{0}', true) }}`, and `${{ true }}` beside `ref: ...head['sha']` on actions/checkout v7.0.1, where OBAAF reported nothing at all. The rule tested the text for `true`; GitHub hands the action what the expression evaluates to. Now anything but a plainly false value counts (`false`, `0`, `no`, or a constant expression of one), and the value is a fact.

### OBAAF-GHA-011 Checkout leaves the job token on disk

**Held.** The default; `on: [pull_request, push]`; `False`, `'false '`, `no`, `0` (not reported, which is right); an expression that evaluates true; `TRUE`; an empty value; `Persist-Credentials: false` (not reported: input names are read without regard to case); a second checkout; a `token:` input; an agent recognised from its install line.

**Got through, fixed.**

- *A job a pull request starts, with another trigger beside it* (`on: [pull_request, workflow_dispatch]`, or with `schedule`): the rule applied to jobs in the untrusted lane, which needs every trigger to be a pull request's. Now any job an outsider's event can start is covered.
- *Identity:* a read-only `pull_request` job and a `pull_request_target` job that can write were the same finding (no facts). Now the triggers, whether the job runs an agent and what the token can write are facts.
- *An agent run by its path* (`$HOME/.local/bin/claude -p`) did not make an agent job, so GHA-011 and GHA-012 did not apply. Now a path, a quote or a backquote may come before an agent CLI's name, and a quote after it (lane assignment, in `data/detection.yaml`).

**False positives fixed.** `persist-credentials: ${{ false }}`, `${{ 'false' }}` and `off` were reported; actions/checkout keeps the token only for `true`. Now a written value other than `true` keeps nothing, and a constant expression is evaluated.

**Found by the review of the fixes.** A personal token (`token: ${{ secrets.ADMIN_PAT }}`) or an SSH key kept by checkout was reported as the job token, with the facts of a read-only job. Now the credential is named and is a fact.

**Out of scope, stated as limits.** Credentials kept by `gh auth setup-git` or a `git config` a script writes: the rule is about actions/checkout. Called workflows (2d.4).

### OBAAF-GHA-012 Agent reads instructions from the change under review

**Held.** `ref: head.sha` on `pull_request`; a sparse checkout of the instruction files from the head; `workflow_run.head_sha`; the default checkout on `pull_request`; `gh pr checkout` on `issue_comment`.

**Got through, fixed.**

- *`ref: ${{ head.sha || base.sha }}`*: any `ref` whose text held the word `base` was skipped. Now a value that names the head is the head, whatever else it names.
- *`ref: ${{ github.sha }}` or `${{ github.ref }}` on `pull_request`*, both the merge commit, and *the default checkout on `pull_request_review` and `pull_request_review_comment`*, whose ref is the merge commit too: the merge-commit case needed `pull_request` and no `ref`. Now it covers those three events, and a `ref` that is only `github.sha`, `github.ref` or `github.ref_name`.
- *`repository:` the head repository*, *the head from a step's output on `issue_comment`*, upper case, index syntax, `format`, `env`, and *`git fetch <sha>` then `git checkout FETCH_HEAD`*: as for OBAAF-GHA-002. A value the checker cannot read is case `unresolved` (medium) where an outsider's event can start the job; on `push` it is not reported.
- *Instruction files fetched one by one*: `git show <head>:CLAUDE.md > CLAUDE.md` and `gh api .../contents/CLAUDE.md?ref=<head>`. Now reported as `fetch`.
- *Identity:* the same checkout on `pull_request` (a fork's run gets no secrets) and on `pull_request_target` were one finding. Now the triggers are a fact.

**Not fixed, stated as limits.** What the agent itself fetches while it runs; values passed between steps; other checkout actions; called workflows and composite actions (2d.4).

### What changed for adopters

Every finding of OBAAF-GHA-002, 011, 012 and 019 has new facts, so a v0.2 baseline entry for one of them, written before this change, no longer accepts it: it becomes new and needs accepting again (the upgrade note says so). A v0.1 baseline (0.3.0) still names these findings: each carries the message 0.3.0 wrote for it, and `obaaf baseline migrate` carries such an entry over with the new facts. On this repository, the newly covered `pull_request` job in the escape tests is accepted by an `ignore` entry in `.github/obaaf.yml` (owner `@seanudeke`, until 2027-05-14), because the kept token is the fixture for the egress action's refusal test. On Expectrail at `9dc79d5`, one finding is new: `expectrail-comment.yml`, job `judge`, checks out `${{ steps.start.outputs.base }}` on `workflow_run` after a pull request, which the checker cannot read (medium, "cannot tell"); Expectrail pins an older OBAAF commit, so its gate does not change until it upgrades.

**False positives seen and not fixed** (ordinary bugs, for later): `pull_request_review` and `pull_request_review_comment` count as privileged for OBAAF-GHA-001 and 002, though GitHub gives a fork's run on them a read-only token and no secrets; and a job that calls a reusable workflow gets OBAAF-GHA-013 "runs on no labels".
